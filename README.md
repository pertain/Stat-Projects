#Stat Projects

There are several plots here that were written in R. I submitted presentations
and reports containing these plots in my Statistical Inference course (Summer 2014).

R was not a requirement of the course. We were permitted to use any tool(s) of
our choosing to accomplish the project requirements. I took advantage of this
opportunity to learn about the R language, and I am grateful that I did. It was
an enjoyable experience.
